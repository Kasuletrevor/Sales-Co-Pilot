# 💼 AI Sales Research Agent (LangChain Implementation)

This project is a **code-based AI sales copilot** that empowers sales representatives to conduct automated prospect and company research, and generate structured pre-call reports. It is the **programmatic version** of the no-code "Sales Copilot" Agent done by Liam Ottley using Relevance AI and showcased in this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0H1-b044KY).

> 🧠 This solution uses **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and basic web scraping to create a highly modular, extensible, and open-source AI research assistant for sales teams.
